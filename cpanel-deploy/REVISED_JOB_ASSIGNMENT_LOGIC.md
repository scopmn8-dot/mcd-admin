# Revised Job Assignment Logic with Enhanced Sequencing

## Overview

The job assignment logic has been completely revised to implement proper sequencing and status management according to the following requirements:

1. **Every driver should have one active job at a time**
2. **Jobs assigned to drivers should have a sequence they follow (`order_no`)**
3. **When a driver completes one job, the next in `order_no` is made active**
4. **All jobs should have 'Pending' status unless it's the active job for the driver**

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Job Assignment Logic

**File**: `backend/index.js` (Lines ~1080-1200)

The assignment logic now includes:
- **Proper Sequencing**: Each job gets an `order_no` field (1, 2, 3, etc.) for each driver
- **Status Management**: First job is `active`, all others are `pending`
- **Active Job Control**: Only one job per driver can be `active` at any time

```javascript
// Set initial job properties with proper sequencing
job.order_no = 1; // This will be the first job for the driver
job.job_status = 'active'; // First job is active
job.job_active = 'true';

// All subsequent jobs are pending
job.order_no = orderNo;
job.job_status = 'pending';
job.job_active = 'false';
```

### 2. Improved Job Completion Processing

**Function**: `processJobCompletion()` (Lines ~1800-1950)

Enhanced to handle:
- **Automatic Sequencing**: When a job completes, the next in sequence becomes active
- **Order Management**: Maintains proper `order_no` sequence (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Status Updates**: Completed jobs become inactive, next job becomes active
- **Dual Field Support**: Maintains both `order_no` and `driver_order_sequence` for compatibility

```javascript
// Reassign order_no to all jobs and manage active status
for (const job of sortedDriverJobs) {
  if (job.job_status === 'completed') {
    job.order_no = sequence++;
    job.job_active = 'false';
  } else {
    job.order_no = sequence++;
    if (!activeJobSet) {
      job.job_active = 'true';
      job.job_status = 'active';
      activeJobSet = true;
    } else {
      job.job_active = 'false';
      job.job_status = 'pending';
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### A. Enhanced Job Assignment with Sequencing
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/assign-jobs-with-sequencing`

- Assigns unassigned jobs to drivers with proper sequencing
- Implements intelligent load balancing
- Sets first job as `active`, others as `pending`
- Considers geographical proximity and current workload

#### B. Complete Job Assignment Overview
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/jobs/all-assignments`

- Returns all jobs grouped by driver with proper sequencing
- Shows active/pending/completed status for each job
- Provides driver statistics and workload distribution

#### C. Driver-Specific Job Queue
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/drivers/:driverName/queue`

Enhanced to show:
- Jobs ordered by `order_no`
- Clear identification of active job
- Separation of completed/pending jobs

#### D. Job Completion Handler
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/jobs/complete`

- Marks job as completed
- Automatically activates the next job in sequence
- Updates all affected jobs with proper status

### 4. Automatic Monitoring System

**Function**: `monitorSheetChanges()` (Lines ~1700-1800)

- Runs every 30 seconds automatically
- Detects when jobs are marked as completed in Google Sheets
- Automatically triggers sequence updates
- Maintains driver job queues in real-time

## Database Schema Changes

### New/Enhanced Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `order_no` | Integer | Primary sequence number for driver jobs (1, 2, 3, etc.) |
| `driver_order_sequence` | Integer | Legacy field maintained for compatibility |
| `job_status` | String | `active`, `pending`, or `completed` |
| `job_active` | Boolean | `true` only for the current active job per driver |
| `selected_driver` | String | Driver name assigned to the job |

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Assign Jobs with Proper Sequencing
```bash
POST http://localhost:4000/api/assign-jobs-with-sequencing
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully assigned 25 jobs to drivers with proper sequencing",
  "assigned": [
    {
      "job_id": "JOB001",
      "assigned_driver": "John Doe",
      "order_no": 1,
      "status": "active",
      "reason": "same-region"
    },
    {
      "job_id": "JOB002", 
      "assigned_driver": "John Doe",
      "order_no": 2,
      "status": "pending",
      "reason": "same-region"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Complete a Job
```bash
POST http://localhost:4000/api/jobs/complete
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "job_id": "JOB001",
  "driver_name": "John Doe"
}
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "completedJob": "JOB001",
  "updatedJobs": 3,
  "nextActiveJob": {
    "job_id": "JOB002",
    "order_no": 2,
    "collection_address": "123 Main St, London",
    "delivery_address": "456 Oak Ave, Manchester"
  },
  "message": "Job JOB001 marked as completed. 3 jobs updated. Next active job: JOB002"
}
```

### 3. Get Driver Queue
```bash
GET http://localhost:4000/api/drivers/John%20Doe/queue
```

```json
{
  "driver": "John Doe",
  "totalJobs": 5,
  "completedCount": 1,
  "pendingCount": 3,
  "activeJob": {
    "job_id": "JOB002",
    "order_no": 2,
    "job_status": "active",
    "job_active": true,

    "delivery_full_address": "456 Oak Ave, Manchester"
  },
  "pendingJobs": [
    {

      "order_no": 3,
      "job_status": "pending",
      "job_active": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Clear Job Sequencing**: Each driver has a clear order of jobs to follow
2. **Automatic Progression**: Jobs automatically progress from pending → active → completed
3. **Single Active Job**: Prevents confusion with multiple active jobs per driver
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatic detection of job completion from Google Sheets
5. **Load Balancing**: Intelligent assignment considering geography and current workload
6. **Comprehensive APIs**: Full CRUD operations for job management
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing field names while adding new functionality

## Monitoring and Logging

The system provides comprehensive logging:
- Job assignment details with reasoning
- Driver workload distribution
- Automatic sequence updates
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

All operations are logged with timestamps and provide detailed feedback about the assignment process, making it easy to track and debug any issues.

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update the frontend components to display the new sequencing
2. **Driver Mobile App**: Integrate with driver apps to show current active job and queue
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics tracking for assignment efficiency
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Consider time-based scheduling for future enhancements

The revised system ensures that every driver has a clear, ordered workflow while maintaining system reliability and providing comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
